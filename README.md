My good Nuxt.js project

You can see a variety of dogs around the world.
In rooted page many buttons of dog name are listed, and when you click one of them moving to a page on that you will see a bunch of dog photos of that breed.

Other functions and improvements of this app will be committed I'm planning now.

Thanks
